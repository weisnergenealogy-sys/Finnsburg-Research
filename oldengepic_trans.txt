Chapter II
The Attack on Finnsburg
In constrast to the remoteness, the detached and moralizing
method, of the poet of the Beowulf, the Singer of Finns-
burg comes to close quarters with his them, and treats it
in nervous, direct, dramatic fashion. Fragment as this
is, it serves to stamp its maker as no bookman, but a min-
strel, who knew how to rouse his hearers in the hall with
living words.
